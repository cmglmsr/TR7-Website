aboutUs: "As TR7 Cyber Security Inc., we set off to eliminate external dependency on load balancing, application distribution and application security, which is one of the areas where our country needs improvement in national cyber security, and to minimize the security gaps that may arise. With the prediction that international wars will take place with cyber elements instead of weapons, our work started in 2008 with producing domestic and national Load Balancer and Web Application Firewall as TRScaler and today continues with the addition of high performance and innovative features to our current technology with the TR7 brand name.
